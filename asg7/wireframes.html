	<h1>Part 3: Wireframing questions</h1>
<p>Question 1: Sketching out the wireframing can be useful in some instances. 
	It's good for speed, to put down thoughts quickly. It's also very flexible. 
	Easily to brainstorm without the constrictions of a website. However, sketching is difficult to duplicate for professional projects.
It's also difficult for multiple people to work on it at the same time. </p>
<p>Answers to question 2: I think multiple types of wireframes would work well with my project. Perhaps I'd start with a sketch to simplfy it.
	I prefer when my ideas have less constraints to start off. Then I would transfer this wireframe to either a paper cut out, or even a digital wireframing tool.
