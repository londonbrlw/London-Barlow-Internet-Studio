	<h1>Avatar Aang For president</h1>
	<p>AAvatar Aang is from the Avatar The Last Airbender series. Heâ€™s an air nomad, known for being peaceful. Due to him being an avatar, he can control all 4 elements. He has several close knit companions, and surrounds himself with good influences. These companions include his flying bison appa, and winged lemur momo. 
 </p>
	<p>Avatar Aang would make a good president due to his peaceful credentials. At age 12 he fought firelord Ozai, and (spoilers ahead) refused to kill him. Instead he opted to remove his firebending, an ability Aang did not know was possible at the time. He also cares for animals, and is vegetarian. His role as the avatar is to maintain peace and balance in the world, making for a perfect president.
