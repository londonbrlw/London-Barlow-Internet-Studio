	<h1>Introducing: The Queens</h1>
	<p>An all womens dodgeball team. These characters were chosen under the assumption that cheating is not allowed</p>
	<h3>Evelyn Wang</h3>
	<p>From the movie everything everywhere all at once. While cheating is not allowed, is it cheating if she summons the skills of a pro dodgeball player? 
		It's technically still Evelyn playing the game. The refs have allowed it. This makes her the perfect canidate for our main offense.</p>
	<h3>Avatar Korra</h3>
	<p>From avatar: the legend of Korra. Korra is strong witted and defensive. She is also very strong, good for defense.</p>
	<h3>Violet</h3>
	<p>From Arcane: the series. Violet is also a strong female character. She would be able to hold defense down well.</p>
	<h3>Gwen Stacy</h3>
	<p>From into the spiderverse. I picked gwen due to her skills as a superhero. She would likely be quick, and make good offense.</p>
	<h3>Garnet</h3>
	<p>From Stephen Universe. Garnet is the perfect leader. She would direct the team and hold everything together.</p>
