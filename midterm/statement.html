	<p>The first TypeFace picked for the project was Alfa Slab One, a slab serif, for h1 and h2 portions. This TypeFace is futuristic and grabs attention. 
		Big bold letters. I wanted a font that matched with the theme of the website, Sci-Fi related. </p>
		<p>
The second TypeFace, for the paragraph portions is: Special Gothic. This font is sleek, modern, and easy to read.

		<h2>Design Choices:</h2>
		<img src="Midterm-Internet/MidtermColors.png" alt="Image of color pallete" style="width: 500px; height: auto; ">
	<p>EFor the color palette, I color dropped from the very first image on the index.html. The orange was a perfect hue for a pop of color on the website.
		I wanted the rest of the website to be monochrome, to make the images of the planet contrast against the webpage. The background is supposed to feel futuristic 
		and give a Sci-Fi feel. I added easy navigation buttons that have an orange animation, and friendly rounded edges. The back button makes it easy to navigate the 
		website. The text was placed into text boxes for easy legibility and sectioning. On the home page it is not centered for an asymmetrical look. The other pages have 
		this effect centered to keep it simple.
