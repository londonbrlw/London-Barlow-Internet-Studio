	<p>When arriving to Vesta, you’ll witness a sightseeing opportunity of a lifetime. The planet, viewed from the comfort of a luxury spaceship. 
		Known for its dark reds, deep greens, and light blue tint. You’ll also view storms swirling on the surface. We will point out biomes and 
		landmarks from thousands of miles in the sky. Complete with a starry view.

		<h2>2.) The Hollow Catacombs:</h2>

	<p>One of the most chilling locations on the entire planet, only tour this area if you have a strong stomach. While the hollow creatures no longer 
		dwell in these catacombs, there used to be hundreds that lived here. The nest stretches for miles underground similar to a maze. 
		The hollows would trap their prey in these caves, leaving the prey unable to escape.

	<p>The forests, once known as a mystery, is our fan favorite attraction. Join us in exploring like the original scavengers. View the wildlife and how the ecosystem interacts. 
		The plant life is very interesting, as plants carry electricity. This is where that idea originated.</p>
