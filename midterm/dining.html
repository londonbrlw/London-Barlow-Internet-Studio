	<p>After touring the dessert, Levi’s safe haven provides the perfect oasis. Levi, the first AI, found the area and grew plant life. 
		This was inside the safety of the large dead trees, protected from the harsh weather outside. All of the food here is entirely organic 
		and grown here in the safe haven. View the botanical garden while eating some Vesta style food.

	<p>The demeter, now repurposed ship, was also home to a large garden. The garden was revived by the scavengers, 
		and has been attended to since. Enjoy fresh smoothies and snacks from the very garden the scavengers founded. 
		This is also a very popular attraction due to the large amount of amenities and history tours available on the ship.
