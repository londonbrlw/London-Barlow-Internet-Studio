<p>I discussed with my classmate several different options for my domain name. My webpage involves art occuring for 24 hours. We agreed on a 
	webpage that includes that in the domain name. Utilizing .art also makes the most sense with my final project. The domain name I liked the best was 24hr.art. This was
due to how inexpensive it was, and it matched with my project the best.</p>
