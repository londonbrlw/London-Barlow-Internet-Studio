	<p>Mitski is a singer and songwriter. She self released her first two albums when she was in college. 
		I would like to discuss with her her inspirations for the albums and lyrics in her songs. 
		She’s had an interesting career as someone who got famous quite fast.</p>

	<p>Brian Cox is an astrophysicist. He often researches black holes, and other space related topics. 
		I saw a lecture of his a few years back, and I would like to see him again. He breaks down complicated topics very simply and in a fun way. 
		It would be food for thought party too.</p>

	<p>I also couldn’t pass up the opportunity to see Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, known as AOC, if given the chance. 
		She used to be a waitress, as I used to be a waitress, which is a common ground. She is very inspirational and I like her values. </p>
