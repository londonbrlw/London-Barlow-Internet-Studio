	<h1>Assignment 2- part 1</h1>
	<p>In the readings, I learned about Web 3.0 and how data is not owned but shared. 
I also learned how the web has developed over the decades and taken shape to what it presents now.
Finally, I discovered context to coding, and types of code that have developed. </p>
<h1>Assignment1 (part2)</h1>
	<p>My idea for the final project is a website where people could body double together.
This idea essentially would be similar to a facetime, where users sign in, and use other people to motivate them
to get work done/complete tasks/stop procrastinating by working together. </p>
