	<h1>The 6 Hats</h1>
<h2>In relation to my final project</h2>
	<p>I interviewed my roommate about my midterm project. I’ve been debating between 2 ideas for the project, 
		and wanted her opinion. After hearing her opinion on which is better, I decided on a 24HR art website. 
		Artists can draw pieces on the website, and upload them. Each piece will stay on the website for 24 hours, 
		before disappearing forever. The concept behind the website is to allow artists to detach from their pieces. 
		There would be a “Like” and “report” system on the website. This was all of the information I had at the beginning of the interview. 
</p>

<h3>White Hat:</h3>
<p>The very first question she asked was price. Would the website be free to use? Ideally the website would be free. Hypothetically, 
	there could be some premium features (paid brushes to use, extra layers) but none in the near future. My roommate raised a question 
	if there was a way to keep AI art off the website. I assured her that all drawings would be drawn IN the website. The point is to draw 
	inside the website with minimal materials, and create something. 
<h3>Red Hat:</h3>
<p>She came up with the idea of adding optional daily prompts, inspired by the art movement inktober. 
	These prompts would assist with artists experiencing art block. 
She emphasized that the websites audience should be adult leaning so people take it seriously. 
She liked the impermanence idea, and how temporary it is. The website's UI should be intuitive. </p>

	<h3>Black Hat:</h3>
<p>Some concerns listed were plagiarism and copying. It would be impossible to trace in the website. 
	However, its difficult to plagiarize within the design of the website, but no impossible. 
	She also raised concerns about super Inappropriate drawings /propaganda. While the website would be for adults, 
	there would be themes kept off the website (listed in rules). I already knew there would be a report feature that would reduce this type of art. 
She also worried about the art disappearing. If the artist so wishes, they could screenshot their art. Although, this does defeat the point of the website. 
</p>

	<h3>Yellow Hat:</h3>
	My roommate thought this was a good low stakes outlet for artistic individuals. It’s easy to draw once a day, 
	without worrying if it looks good. Uploading for the sake of creating and detaching. 
It’s a good lesson on impermanence and creating for the sake of having fun. Many people who may not be into art may also enjoy it as well. 

	<h3>Green Hat: </h3>
<p>My roommate also added the idea of a paragraph caption for what their art represents. 
	The artist could list a textbox stating the meaning behind their piece. I liked this idea,
	but I want to keep the meaning a mystery. I may add a title feature.  
She also came up with the idea of having a ranking system after the 24hrs. 
	The top 5 artists with the most likes, would be showcased for an extra day. Very low stakes still, but it does create a goal. 
	I’m considering adding the top 10 or 20 to lower the stakes further. 
</p>

	<H3>Blue Hat:</H3>
	<p>Blue: 
Overall, My roommate felt most drawn towards the Yellow hat. A more optimistic feel for my website. 
		It reminded her of the best aspects of other games she has played beforehand. She decided that overall this would be very useful for artists to use, 
		and develop their skill. The low stakes are very appealing. Even though she doesn’t consider herself an artist, she would use the website.</p>

	<h3>My own hat:</h3>

<p>The hat from the exercise that resonates with me the most is the red hat. I'm very in tune with my emotions, sometimes more-so than logic. </p>
