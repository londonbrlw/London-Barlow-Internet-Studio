	<h1>The 6 Hats</h1>
<h2>In relation to my final project</h2>
	<p>I interviewed my roomate, </p>

<h3>White Hat:</h3>
<p>The very first question she asked was price. Would the website be free to use? Ideally the website would be free. Hypothetically, 
	there could be some premium features (paid brushes to use, extra layers) but none in the near future. My roommate raised a question 
	if there was a way to keep AI art off the website. I assured her that all drawings would be drawn IN the website. The point is to draw 
	inside the website with minimal materials, and create something. 
<h3>Red Hat:</h3>
<p>She came up with the idea of adding optional daily prompts, inspired by the art movement inktober. 
	These prompts would assist with artists experiencing art block. 
She emphasized that the websites audience should be adult leaning so people take it seriously. 
She liked the impermanence idea, and how temporary it is. The website's UI should be intuitive.
